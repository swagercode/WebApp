# Python Files Are Read-Only

- Do not create, modify, rename, or delete any `.py` files.
- Do not run tools that would indirectly rewrite `.py` files.
- If a requested task requires Python changes, stop and tell the user the requirements. Do not directly suggest code.
- Prefer frontend/static-only changes unless the user clearly overrides this rule.
