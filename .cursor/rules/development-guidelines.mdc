# StudySpot Development Guidelines

## Learning Philosophy
This project serves as a comprehensive full-stack development course, where you'll learn by building a real-world application. The approach will be:

1. **Challenge-Based Learning**: You'll receive small, manageable coding challenges that gradually increase in difficulty
2. **Progressive Difficulty**: Challenges are designed to match your experience level and build upon previous knowledge
3. **Starter Code Provided**: Each challenge comes with starter code to help you get started
4. **Interactive Learning**: Work through challenges independently, then check back for guidance and validation

## Development Guidelines
1. **No Complete Solutions**: You'll receive starter code and guidance, but must implement solutions yourself
2. **Challenge-Based**: Each feature is broken down into smaller challenges
3. **Self-Paced Learning**: Work through challenges at your own pace
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Challenges increase in difficulty as you gain experience
5. **Code Review**: Regular check-ins to validate your solutions and provide feedback

## Learning Path
The development will follow this general path:
1. Project setup and understanding the architecture
2. Backend fundamentals with Go
3. Frontend development with Svelte
4. Database integration with Firestore
5. API integration with Google Places
6. Advanced features and optimizations

## Challenge Structure
Each challenge will include:
1. Clear learning objectives
2. Starter code to build upon
3. Specific requirements to implement
4. Hints if you get stuck
5. Validation of your solution

## Getting Started
To begin our development journey:
1. Review the project structure
2. Set up your development environment
3. Start with your first challenge
4. Implement the solution
5. Check back for validation and next steps

## Next Steps
1. Complete the environment setup challenge
2. Begin with basic Go backend challenges
3. Progress to Svelte frontend challenges
4. Move on to database integration challenges
5. Tackle API integration challenges


Always refer to the current documentation for Svelte:

# Svelte Documentation for LLMs

> Svelte is a UI framework that uses a compiler to let you write breathtakingly concise components that do minimal work in the browser, using languages you already know — HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Documentation Sets

- [Abridged documentation](mdc:https:/svelte.dev/llms-medium.txt): A shorter version of the Svelte and SvelteKit documentation, with examples and non-essential content removed
- [Compressed documentation](mdc:https:/svelte.dev/llms-small.txt): A minimal version of the Svelte and SvelteKit documentation, with many examples and non-essential content removed
- [Complete documentation](mdc:https:/svelte.dev/llms-full.txt): The complete Svelte and SvelteKit documentation including all examples and additional content

## Individual Package Documentation

- [Svelte documentation](mdc:https:/svelte.dev/docs/svelte/llms.txt): This is the developer documentation for Svelte.
- [SvelteKit documentation](mdc:https:/svelte.dev/docs/kit/llms.txt): This is the developer documentation for SvelteKit.
- [the Svelte CLI documentation](mdc:https:/svelte.dev/docs/cli/llms.txt): This is the developer documentation for the Svelte CLI.

## Notes

- The abridged and compressed documentation excludes legacy compatibility notes, detailed examples, and supplementary information
- The complete documentation includes all content from the official documentation
- Package-specific documentation files contain only the content relevant to that package
- The content is automatically generated from the same source as the official documentation
